our father who art in heaven
hallow be thy name
thy kingdom come
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
forgive us for our tresspasses as we forgive those who tresspass against us
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom
the power and the glory
forever and ever
amen

God I offer myself to thee
to build with me and to do with me as thou wilt.
releive me of the bondage of self, that i may better do thy will
take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those i would help 
of thy power, thy love and thy way of life
may better do thy will aways
amen
